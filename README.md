# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

# Project Overview
Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of JavaScript projects, making code cleaner and more efficient.
A Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. 

# Project Brief
For this project , I used the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information to ensure that the banking system has a single point of information for all branches.


# Elements included 
- Ensure that your code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
- Your GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
Although I understood the brief and was able to code the solution that was required, I would not necessarily say that I am confident in my understanding of the topics covered in the project, and therfore have no clear areas of mastery.

### Challenges faced 
Not many challenges were faced in this project. Even with my limited understanding, I was able to code the solution based on common sense and the guidance of the provided resources that are supposed to be used. 

### Areas of Improvement 
A huge area of improvement for me would be the understanding and grasping of the knowledge and skills that were displayed in this project. I plan to go back to the learning material and also find other resources that explain further. 

## Overall learning experience
For the overall learning experience I'd rate this project between 5-6 as I was able to understand the brief and code the solution, I was, however, not satisfied with my overall understanding of the coding solution that I provided.
